The UI/UX project was completed by the talented designers, Ms. Mothla Alnoshan and Ms. Haneen, for Brmjha Company.

## What is the Idea?
Work together with the development team to build a website support system that accommodates multiple languages. The website's core idea is to offer a diverse range of quotes, including inspirational, book, and love quotes, in various languages, with seamless language-switching capabilities for users.
